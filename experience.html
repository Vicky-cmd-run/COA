        <h1>My COA Experience üëå</h1>
        <p>
        When I saw this under the ECE course code, my mind had a question‚Äîwhy? I‚Äôm already in the 4th semester, and I‚Äôm still
        being forced to study an ECE subject. But I had confidence in Agam Das Sir because I had already experienced his
        classroom style and teaching.
        
        The subject also started off a little boring here and there. Then came the concepts from my 2nd semester subject, DLD,
        which boosted my interest in this subject. Gradually, when I was taught about processors, it made me wonder how a tiny
        material that fits inside my palm is capable of doing unimaginable tasks. This fired up my interest in the subject even
        more.
        
        As the modules were completed one after another, I realized that even for a simple task we do on a computer, there are
        millions of actions taking place behind the scenes. I‚Äôm not 100% sure that I now have complete clarity about everything
        that happens in a computer‚Äîhow memory is allocated, interrupt cases, and the magic of pipelining. Still, this subject
        makes me curious every day about how people in the past had the idea of making machines to help humans, creating
        different languages for them to "speak" to machines, and now, how machines are all set to replace humans in many
        sectors.
        
        If 10 years ago, someone told us we would be in quarantine and that a virus like corona would wage a war on humans
        around the world, we would have laughed our teeth out. But we faced it. Similarly, these inventions, ideologies, and
        algorithms mesmerize the world and prove that everything is impossible‚Äîuntil you try.
